# Changelog

All notable changes to the Registre des Armées desktop app are recorded here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the
project follows the version in `web/package.json`.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- Desktop app icon (Imperial Eagle) branding the app, installer, and taskbar.

### Changed
- Within a brigade, foot and horse artillery are treated as one type and sorted
  together by cost, instead of always placing foot guns before horse guns.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-15

### Changed
- Combat generals now count against the foot/horse artillery caps of the unit
  they lead — they can no longer push a build past 2 foot / 1 horse gun.
- The unit-class filters (Grenadiers, Line, etc.) now also match combat generals
  associated with that unit class.
- The support division (final artillery/sapper/skirmisher division) no longer
  earns any brigade or division cost discount.

### Fixed
- Untagged reserve artillery was being merged into the final *combat* division on
  some corps (e.g. 1812 7. Junot); it now forms its own support division.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- Staff generals that would exceed the 10,000 cost limit are greyed out and
  cannot be selected.

### Changed
- The Infantry/Cavalry/Artillery category filters now also match a combat general
  by its base unit type, not only the Generals category.
- Default grid density is now Compact.
- Brigade ordering: mixed unit types order infantry/skirmishers, cavalry, then
  artillery (cost-desc within each type).
- The unit-cap badge shows shared cap-group usage, so a base unit and its combat
  general both read e.g. 2/2 when the shared cap is reached.

### Fixed
- The unit-cap badge is no longer clipped by the portrait frame.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Army-builder fixes; Windows desktop build.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Army-builder fixes; Windows desktop build.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-14

### Added
- Initial beta: NTW3 army builder as a Windows desktop app (Electron) with
  GitHub-based auto-update.
